    <h2>About Me...</h2>
    <h4>Web Desinger, Developer and Photographer</h4>
    <p>My name is Brandan Majeske; I am a web designer, developer, and photographer. I live in Meridian, Idaho. I enjoy creating web sites and apps, and also working with visual mediums like photography and illustration. It's the creative challenges that come along with each new project that keep me coming back. There's nothing like facing a challenge, solving a problem or ten along the way, and being able to say, "See that marvelous thing there? I did that!"</p>
    <p>My web-education started about five years ago with a desire to create my own blog. I didn't know much about web servers or mark up languages, but I was determined to learn. I started to learn HTML, CSS and eventually some PHP. Today I am happy to say I am quite comfortable with what makes the web work. I recently graduated with honors from <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/" target="_blank" alt="link to fullsail.edu">Full Sail University</a> with a Bachelor of Science degree in Web Design and Development.</p>
    <p>My design philosophy is user-centric; I know who I need to have in mind when I sit down to create a site or app. If it isn't usable, it isn't much good - no matter how pretty it is! I've spent a fair amount of time studying what makes a good User Experience. A great experience is the aim of all my design intentions.</p>
