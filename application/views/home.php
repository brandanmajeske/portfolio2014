			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Generally I don't like to talk about myself, but since this is my portfolio website I feel I should probably say a few words about where I'm from, what some of my accomplishments are, and my approach to web design and development.</p>

			<h2>My Blog</h2>
			<p>Many blogs today are the modern-day equivalent to journaling in public. My blog falls into this category. I try to spend a few minutes each week putting my thoughts about things in text form. As it's my personal blog, it isn't always about the web.</p>
